<p><i>I knew exactly what I wanted my tattoo to be, and even with no exact reference pictures, Carlos was able to make it happen! I will definitely come back here for another tattoo in the future.</i></p>

<p><i>Rebecca gave me a beautiful tattoo, and I don't think I could have gotten anything like it anywhere else! It is so unique and personalized... I love it!</i></p>

<p><i>I got a tattoo from Sarah, and she was so helpful and kind. I came in with just an idea, and she brought it to life! She even helped me spell the words in the tattoo correctly, and she helped me write this review too... reading and writing were never a strongsuit of mine.</p>
